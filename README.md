# Tele-Nutrition

#This repository is for our CSE499 (Senior Design) project. We are developing an web version application.
The importance of nutrition cannot be overstated in human life. Malnutrition, on the other hand, increases tension, fatigue, and the disability to perform. Over time, it has also raised the chance of developing many diseases and other health problems. Nowadays, people have been facing nutrition problems and are concerned about their health. As a result, nutritionists assist them in resuming or maintaining healthy, autonomous lives at home. This paper presents a web-based Telenutrition application system with a variety of features to aid in doctor-patient communication. This online application allows a user to register as a doctor or a patient. An administrator can manage all aspects of the system, as well as regulate and change its functioning. A nutritionist qualification has been verified manually by the system administrator. However, patients can use the application to choose from several treatment options. Patients can obtain basic nutrition information in everyday life, receive emergency care, and consult with a nutritionist via video call and text messages. Doctors have been notified after taking an appointment by the patients. Doctors have scheduled a time for the patients to consult and provide services in their homes, and patients have been notified after the doctor's confirmation. This application also allows doctors and patients to chat with one another to find an immediate solution. Even in this application, people who are Covid-19 positive have given special attention. Moreover, doctors can prescribe prescriptions and see a patient's medical history. The method is quick and dependable, with a user-friendly interface, increasing Tele nutritionist services for anyone with internet access across the country.
